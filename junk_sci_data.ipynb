       " '(NaturalNews) If you thought Big Pharma couldn\\'t sink any lower, you were wrong. A recent report led by theand the Center for Public Integrity, has revealed that the manufacturers of opioid drugs, such as OxyContin, Vicodin and fentanyl, spent a whopping $880 million on campaign contributions and lobbying efforts. This huge amount of money was spent pushing against state efforts to restrict the amount of prescription opioid drugs floating around.For the unaware, the United States is currently experiencing an opioid epidemic – one that has been particularly profitable for Big Pharma. OxyContin has been one of the most prolific drugs in the prescription opioid craze, and one of the most addictive.writes that a recent expose by theuncovered the fact that Purdue Pharma knowingly lied about their product. Despite being marketed as a 12-hour pill, the\\' handiwork revealed that Purdue \"knew the claim was a lie, as did its sales reps, patients, medical professional and even regulatory authorities. At best, Oxy only provided eight hours of pain relief ...\"This means that patients were exposed to withdrawal symptoms, received inadequate care, and were often pushed up to a higher dose of OxyContin – which puts patients at increased risk of death. However, higher dosages make more money than more frequent doses, so this was a very clever, and malevolent , marketing choice by Purdue.You can see where this is the kind of company that caresabout public well-being, and quite a lot about profits. It is not surprising that Purdue Pharma, and others like them, have spent nearly a billion dollars trying to protect their hold on the American people. Between 2006 and 2015, Big Pharma spent nearly 200 times more fighting opioid restrictions than opioid restriction advocates spent in the same time period. Sadly, it is not just Big Pharma pushing their agenda. Even organizations that many people consider to be \"respectable,\" have dipped their toes in the pond. The American Cancer Society, for example, has reportedly teamed up with the pharmaceutical industry.Opioids are very similar to heroin, only they can be prescribed to patients as pain relievers. Due to their highly addictive nature, it is no surprise that the industry desperately wants to protect their ability to be prescribed to anyone for just about anything; opioids are a cash cow.Dr. Andrew Kolodny, a tremendous supporter of prescription opioid reform, told the: \"They are reaping enormous profits from aggressive prescribing.\" And while they benefit, millions suffer.Over 2 million Americans reportedly suffer with an addiction to opioid drugs. Just shy of a half-million people suffer with heroin addiction, as well. The National Institute on Drug Abuse reports that roughly 80 percent of all heroin users report that their addiction began with misusing opioid drugs . Being that prescription opioids are rather expensive, it is no surprise that people eventually move on to less expensive options. This figure shows that it is not just people currently using prescription opioids that are being harmed by these drugs, but many others as well. One could even postulate that a significant portion of heroin overdoses could be traced back to opioids, in addition to the thousands of deaths caused by opioids directly. Some estimates indicate that opioids are related to up to 60 deaths each day Spending $880 million on protecting their profits instead of supporting legislation that would help to end the opioid epidemic ensured that their priorities would be easily understood. Despite the claims of Big Pharma companies like Purdue that they actually care about addiction and the people affected by it, it has becomeclear that thethey care about is the fact that it makes them money.',\n",
       " '1. Dairy is an allergen and lactose intolerance trigger\\n\\n2. Most people are actually lactose intolerant and don\\'t know it\\n\\n3. Dairy weakens bones, can lead to osteoporosis and is linked to cancer\\n\\n4. Dairy products are particularly susceptible to radiation contamination\\n\\n(NaturalNews) Dairy foods make a delicious and satisfying complement to many people\\'s diets. However, there is a large body of evidence that suggests that most people\\'s bodies are just not well equipped to digest and process dairy-based foods and beverages (unless you happen to be a Sherpa from the Tibetan highlands). And, as our environment gets more polluted, reasons to reduce dairy consumption increase rather than stay the same. Here are some convincing reasons to reduce or even eliminate dairy from your diet:Consumption of dairy has varying effects on different people. Some people are so sensitive to dairy that ingesting even a small amount can be fatal if they have anaphylaxis, a severe, potentially fatal allergic reaction that can result in rashes, swelling, hives, itching, trouble breathing, wheezing or even loss of consciousness. In a separate category from allergenics are people who are lactose intolerant. Lactose intolerance happens when a person is lacking lactase, an enzyme which breaks down the lactose sugars in dairy. Without lactase, a person cannot break down and digest dairy foods and may experience bloating, cramps, gas and diarrhea.Most people in the world are actually lactose intolerant but are unaware of it. It is estimated that 75% of the world\\'s citizens generally lack the lactase enzyme needed to break down lactose into the simpler sugar forms glucose and galactose, which the body can process effectively. For most of the 20th century, it has been generally accepted that almost all humans could break down lactose, but this was proven incorrect by research conducted during the 1960s which found that most people lose the lactase enzyme after being weaned as children, usually between the ages of two and five. A small percentage of humans, such as Tibetan Sherpas and their relatives, do retain the lactase enzyme throughout adulthood, due to evolutionary adaptivity.Most of us have been deceived by the USDA\\'s nutritional guidelines into believing that dairy is a healthy part of a balanced diet, and that \"diets rich in milk and dairy products help build and maintain bone mass throughout the lifecycle and may reduce the risk of osteoporosis .\" These statements unfortunately are misleading and even dangerous. Studies have found that the highest rates of osteoporosis occur in countries with high consumption of animal products. This research suggests that, rather than building strong bones and teeth, dairy products prevent calcium from being absorbed in the body.High quality plant-based foods, such as broccoli, kale and collard greens, provide much more easily absorbable calcium than dairy. These should be used in place of dairy as healthy sources of calcium.There are many other convincing reasons to avoid dairy besides the risk of osteoporosis. Research has shown that dairy consumption is linked to cancer, heart disease and diabetes.Ever since the Fukushima disaster in 2011, researchers have been testing foods and vegetables for radioactivity. The Department of Nuclear Engineering at UC Berkeley has been taking radiation samples since the Fukushima meltdown. They have tested both raw milk and store-bought, and have detected radioactive isotopes cesium-134 and 137 (Cs-134, Cs-137). This is alarming when you consider dairy as a \"radioactive indicator\" of our food supply. Dairy is a good indicator for radiation, because cows consume grass, food crops and water supplies. In simple terms, when dairy starts testing positive for radioactivity, it\\'s an indication of radioactive contamination of the entire food supply.Zach C.

       " 'Fermented vegetables\\n\\nKefir\\n\\nKombucha\\n\\nApple cider vinegar\\n\\n(NaturalNews) With estimates that the body has 10 times more bacteria than cells (approximately 10 trillion), it becomes pretty clear that maintaining a proper bacterial balance is vital for long-term health. An important factor in that balance is plenty of probiotics (good bacteria) in order to keep the optimal balance of 85 percent good bacteria to 15 percent bad bacteria in check. These probiotic foods will help achieve just that.Man has been fermenting vegetables for thousands of years as a way to preserve their harvest (much like pickling). However, it has been more recently accepted that fermented vegetables are not just a good preservation system but also an exceptional way to ingest high quality and live probiotics.Consuming fermented vegetables keep bad bacteria and yeast in check, as the lactic acid producing lactobacilli in these foods alter the acidity in the intestine which helps prevent the overgrowth of unfriendly bacteria, molds, and candida.One of the most commonly fermented vegetables is sauerkraut, which simply consists of cabbage, salt, and a culture starter if desired. However, nearly any vegetable can be fermented and can be stored for months and even years under the right conditions.Kefir is a fermented drink that can be made from milk, water, grains, and coconut water. Although it is not a good preservation method, the fermenting of these mediums can produce a probiotic-rich beverage that is not only delicious, but also healing for the digestive system.Consuming kefir will ensure your body is fed a wide variety of beneficial bacteria that will enhance hydration and recolonize your gut and mucous membranes. It also contains beneficial yeasts that are known to hunt down and destroy pathogenic yeasts in the body, as well as detoxify the liver and fortify the immune system.All the ingredients you would need to make kefir are your desired liquid, small amount of sugar (not required to start dairy kefir), and a kefir starter (probiotic).Made from sweetened tea that\\'s been fermented by a symbiotic colony of bacteria and yeast (a SCOBY, or also known as the \"mother\" because of its ability to reproduce), kombucha has been around for more than 2000 years. However, it didn\\'t gain popularity in the West until recently.Consuming kombucha will introduce a wide array of enzymes and bacterial acids that will detoxify your liver, aid in digestion, improve your joint health , and boost your immune system.The only ingredients you need to make kombucha are black or green tea, some sugar, and a kombucha starter culture or SCOBY.Apple cider vinegar is a type of vinegar made from fermented apples and has pale to medium amber color. It can be substituted in many food preparations for white vinegar, with exponentially more health benefits.Consuming apple cider vinegar will introduce beneficial enzymes, probiotics , and amino acids that will improve digestion, relieve heartburn, stimulate the lymphatic system, help get rid of candida, and help strengthen the immune system.Making apple cider vinegar is a double fermentation process. First, apples are fermented and reduced to cider, and then the cider is fermented to create apple cider vinegar With all these foods, one can expect to introduce beneficial bacteria, enzymes, and a host of highly digestible vitamins, minerals, and nutrients. This will effectively clean up the digestive system, which will in turn strengthen the immune system as well.These foods just may be the cheapest and best form of healthcare.Derek Henry took a deadly health challenge that conventional medicine couldn\\'t solve and self-directed a one-in-a-million health journey that found him happier and healthier than he had been in his entire life. As a result of this rewarding journey, he now spends his time writing, coaching, and educating thousands of people each month who want to enjoy similar results under their own direction.',\n",
